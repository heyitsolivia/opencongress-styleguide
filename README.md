## OpenCongress Styleguide

This styleguide uses the node verion of Pattern Lab. Refer to [patternlab-node](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node) for more documenation.

### Getting Started

To run patternlab-node, just do the following from the command line at the root of patternlab-node: 

1. `npm install`
2. `npm install -g grunt-cli`
3. `grunt`  

This creates all patterns, the styleguide, and the pattern lab site. `patternlab.json` is a file created for debugging purposes.  It tells you all the secrets in tidy json.

Run `grunt watch` to have patternlab-node watch for changes.
